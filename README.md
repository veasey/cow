# COW - The Next gen of MOORPGs

"I WANT TO BE A COW, I WANT TO BE A COW, I WANT TO BE A COW" - My 3 Year Old.

This is a GODOT script that allows you to move a cow asset around a green field with the keys. I thought it was shut my kid up, but now he cries real tears when I tear him away.

## Future Features?

- [ ] "THE COW WANTS TO EAT THE GRASS"
- [ ] "THE COW WANTS TO BE OUT"
